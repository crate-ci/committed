Enforce commit standards, whether for:
- Readability, especially in logs
- Consistent styling
- Compatibility with programmatic processing

## Install

[Download](https://github.com/crate-ci/committed/releases) a pre-built binary
(installable via [gh-install](https://github.com/crate-ci/gh-install).

Or use rust to install:
```bash
cargo install committed
```

### pre-commit

To use `committed` with [`pre-commit`](https://pre-commit.com), point its
config at this repository:

```yaml
repos:
  - repo: https://github.com/crate-ci/committed
    rev: v1.1.2
    hooks:
      - id: committed
```

The `committed` id installs a prebuilt executable from GitHub releases. If
one does not exist for the target platform, or if one built from
sources is preferred, use `committed-src` as the hook id instead.

Be sure to change `rev` to use the desired `committed` git tag or
revision.

The hook, by default, will verify your commit message.

## Basic Usage

Verify your latest commit
```bash
committed HEAD
```

Verify your branch
```bash
committed master..HEAD --no-merge-commit
```

Have your CI verify your PR (assuming it does a no-ff merge into your `master`)
```bash
committed HEAD~..HEAD^2 --no-merge-commit
```
See [`imperative` for a GitHub Actions
example](https://github.com/crate-ci/imperative/blob/master/.github/workflows/committed.yml)
or look at `committed`s own [GitHub Actions pipeline](.github/workflows/committed.yml),
[`.travis.yml`](.travis.yml), or [`appveyor.yml`](appveyor.yml).
