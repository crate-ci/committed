# `committed` Reference

## Specifying commits

Without any commits specified, `committed` will detect if something is being
piped in on `stdin` and use that, otherwise it will check `HEAD`.

### Commits

```bash
committed HEAD
```

### Commit Ranges

```bash
committed master..HEAD
```

- The range excludes the start commit
- This will Do The Right Thing even when `master` is ahead of when you
  branched. `committed` will look for the merge-base between the range end
  points.

### Commit Files and `stdin`

This is useful for editor integration:

```bash
committed --commit-file <path>
# Or for stdin
committed --commit-file -
```

- This will not run all verification checks, like looking for merge commits.

## Configuration

### Sources

Configuration is read from the following (in precedence order)

- Command line arguments
- Either
  - File specified via `--config PATH`
  - `<git repo directory>/committed.toml`
